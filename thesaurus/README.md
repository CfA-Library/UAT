The UAT in various file formats.

======================================= 
IMPORTANT NOTE: 
--------------- 

We are making available this DRAFT copy of the thesaurus mostly for the benefit of collaborators and developers who are interested in previewing the product while we work on implementing the technical, social, and rights management infrastructure required for its maintenance.  Given these constraints, we ask you that you refrain from further redistributing this content to third parties without prior approval.  We are interested in your feedback, which should be sent to us via our Google Group at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/uat-users or by using our submission form at http://astrothesaurus.org/contact-us/

The current draft was released on 1/1/2013 and consists of a polyhierarchy with 2305 terms, 15 top concepts, and with the majority of the terms 2–4 levels down from the top. There are 224 'related' links in the thesaurus. 

ABOUT THE UAT: 
-------------- 

This Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) is an open, interoperable and community-supported thesaurus which unifies the existing divergent and isolated Astronomy & Astrophysics thesauri into a single high-quality, freely-available open thesaurus formalizing astronomical concepts and their inter-relationships. 

The UAT builds upon the existing IAU Thesaurus with major contributions from the Astronomy portions of the thesauri developed by the Institute of Physics Publishing and the American Institute of Physics.  We expect that the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus will be further enhanced and updated through a collaborative effort involving broad community participation. 

While the AAS has assumed formal ownership of the UAT, the work will be available under a Creative Commons License, ensuring its widest use while protecting the intellectual property of the contributors. We envision that development and maintenance will be stewarded by a broad group of parties having a direct stake in it.  This includes professional associations (IVOA, IAU), learned societies (AAS, RAS), publishers (IOP, AIP), librarians and other curators working for major astronomy institutes and data archives.
