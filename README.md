Overview: 
------------- 
The Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) is an open, interoperable and community-supported thesaurus of astronomical and astrophysical concepts and their relationships. Management of the UAT is based on a community-supported approach to ensure the thesaurus stays current by allowing anyone to suggest an addition or revision which will then be subjected to a thorough expert review process. The UAT is supported by many leading astronomical institutions, professional associations, journal publishers, learned societies, and data repositories as a standard astronomical terminology.
