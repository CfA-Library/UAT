<DD>Needs disambiguation or creation of at least two separate terms. Wikipedia, Coma (cometary): "In astronomy, a coma (from the Greek κόμη, "hair") is the nebulous envelope around the nucleus of a comet." WIkipedia, Coma (optics): "In optics (especially telescopes), the coma (aka comatic aberration) in an optical system refers to aberration inherent to certain optical designs or due to imperfection in the lens or other components which results in off-axis point sources such as stars appearing distorted, appearing to have a tail (coma) like a comet. Specifically, coma is defined as a variation in magnification over the entrance pupil. In refractive or diffractive optical systems, especially those imaging a wide spectral range, coma can be a function of wavelength, in which case it is a form of chromatic aberration." -BG</DD>
