<DD>Per the Wiley Book of Astronomy: "For an object in the solar system, the angle “Sun-objectEarth”; that is, the angle between the Sun and the observer as seen from the given object. It is 0° when the object is fully illuminated, 90° when the object is half-illuminated (like the Moon at first quarter and last quarter), and 180° when the object is between Earth and the Sun (like the Moon at new moon). The Moon, Mercury, and Venus can have phase angles covering the full range 0 to 180°. Mars, on the other hand, has a maximum phase angle of about 45°, meaning that it is always almost fully illuminated." -BG</DD>
