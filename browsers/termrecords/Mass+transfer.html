<DD>Term created to accommodate Mass exchange, also under Stellar activity. Per Wikipedia, Mass transfer: "n astrophysics, mass transfer is the process by which matter gravitationally bound to a body, usually a star, fills its Roche lobe and becomes gravitationally bound to a second body, usually a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole), and is eventually accreted onto it. It is a common phenomenon in binary systems, and may play an important role in some types of supernovae and pulsars." -BG</DD>
