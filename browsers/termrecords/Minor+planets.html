<DD>Terminology somewhat problematic. Per Wikipedia article: "Before 2006 the International Astronomical Union had officially used the term minor planet. During its 2006 meeting, the Union reclassified minor planets and comets into dwarf planets and Small Solar System bodies. Objects are called dwarf planets if their self-gravity is sufficient to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium, that is, an ellipsoidal shape, with all other minor planets and comets called "Small Solar System bodies". The IAU states: "the term 'minor planet' may still be used, but generally the term 'Small Solar System body' will be preferred." However, for purposes of numbering and naming, the traditional distinction between minor planet and comet is still followed." -BG</DD>
